        desc: `This city center is a bit intimidating for someone of your size. Even with specially designated walkways for those small enough to risk being stepped on it was still intimidating to watch dozens of sets of huge paws thundering past on the adjacent sidewalk. And that wasn’t even taking into consideration the true giants walking down the main street bisecting the neighborhood. Any one of them could have flattened entire city blocks in the Micro Metroplex with a single step!
        <br/>Luckily the local convenience store had a micro-friendly entrance beside the main entrance. It was a good thing, too. You doubted anyone of your size could have set off the pressure sensor and prompted the main door to open. But just because they had an entrance for your kind didn’t mean they had much inventory catering to you. The overwhelming majority of the shop’s products were sized for people of an average size rather than tiny people like you or the giants lumbering around outside.
        <br/>Though the Gym has a similar tiny entrance for you and those of your size category the interior is little better than the convenience store. The overwhelming majority of the equipment was sized for creatures far larger than yourself. At your scale it would have taken an entire work crew and a flatbed truck to move around the lightest of the free-weights! The chances of getting an effective workout here were not very high at your size. It was quickly becoming apparent the accommodations for people of your size were meant more for you to admire the normal sized facilities rather than use them.`

        desc: `In a city catering to creatures ranging in size from toys to titans it was almost comforting to have a part of the city for someone of your height. You weren’t supposed to call it the ‘normal’ sized area since that implied that the little and giant people were abnormal. But it was the closest you could get to a district made for someone like you who fell into the median size range. There were still accommodations made for the other sizes, of course. There was a small, roped off section of most sidewalks designated little-only so they didn’t have to share walking space with larger people and risk getting stepped on. In addition, most shops had a smaller entrance for the little people. There wasn’t much they could do to make room for the giants, though. By definition they were the type that took up a lot of space and the best the center of town could offer was to make the city center a car-free zone and designate the roads exclusively for the giants use lest they risk stepping on people like you like you might have for the little people.
        <br/>The convenience store in the central district had a little bit of everything; including even a few things for the other size categories. Though the overwhelming majority of those sections were nothing but merchandise. It was almost funny to see an entire shelving unit outside one of the stores holding up a single pair of shirts sized for giants. Each one was the size of a tarp! While you had your own entrance separate from the little people you still had to watch where you were going unless you wanted to be the one flattened instead of them. Occasionally one of the giants would get down on their hands and knees to peer a giant eye in the window to try and get a look at the inventory or ask one of the clerks a question. 
        <br/>The gym in the area was surprisingly popular for people of your size and hosted an extensive array of equipment. You suspected that many of the people in your size category found themselves inadequate in a city where some were big enough to juggle trucks and worked to improve their athleticism and strength to compensate. Not that the difference between being able to bench press a refrigerator instead of a broom handle or running a mile in five minutes instead of eight would make much of a difference compared to a giant who could crush said refrigerator like an empty soda can and cover the same distance any of them could run with a single step.`

        desc: `This city center was supposed to be the hub for people of all sizes. Sitting as a divider between the little and giant districts it got a lot of traffic from people of all sizes. Though they put in token efforts to cater to both littles and giants it ultimately didn’t make the area any more accommodating for someone of your stature than any other normal city would. Not that they could have done much more than having the roads designated for the paw traffic of people your size. Not when the average building in the city center was barely waist-high to most giants. In the giant district it was sometimes possible for someone of your size to forget how big you were with most things there sized for your kind. So coming to a space like this was a rather pleasant reminder that you were, in fact, huge. 
        <br/>While some of the shops had merch stands in the walkways outside for people of your stature they were token efforts at best. Rarely could you find more than an oversized shirt usually either too big or too small for you saying something like “I went to the central district and left it standing!” in some cheap, half-assed attempt to poke fun at the idea that people of your size could, in fact, decimate the place if you really wanted too. The temptation was stronger sometimes; particularly when you were forced to get on your hands and knees and press your face down into the ground just so you could peer an eye into one of the shop windows and get someone’s attention if you had a question or wanted to buy something. 
        <br/>The gym was far too small for you, of course. It was almost laughable to think that anything in the large, at least by average-sized people’s standards, building could have anything inside it that would be even a remote physical challenge. You would probably get more of a workout trying to lift the building itself than any of its equipment. If you wanted an effective workout this was definitely not the place to go at your size.`

        desc: `It was concerning to be around so many people that were so much larger than you. Sure you had seen giants before but being surrounded by dozens upon dozens of them was something else entirely. It was like a parade of living buildings were strolling their way up and down the street, many casually having conversations in voices so deep and loud that they could have blown out your eardrums if they were closer. And with multiple conversations happening at once it all melted together into a dull roar like you were surrounded by the constant sound of passing airplanes. 
        <br/>The convenience store near the station wasn’t like the shops in Variable Village. It didn’t bother catering for average-sized individuals like yourself. You had to wait until one of the giants stepped on the pressure pad to open the titanic glass doors and rush inside before the airplane hangar-sized doors slid closed behind you. You doubted they had much of anything of use to you here. Even if they did, you doubted you could have carried it out on your own.
        <br/>The gym was similarly unwilling to cater to anyone shorter than a few stories tall. Again you had to wait for someone else to enter and slip in behind them if you wanted to get inside. The interior was sparsely equipped. It wasn’t surprising considering how much material was needed to make any kind of workout equipment big enough for someone big enough to juggle cars to make use of. The scent of sweat was much stronger as well thanks to the gallon-sized droplets of sweat that dripped off of most of the people working out there.`

But here it was their job to watch your step not the other way around. The shops may have been few but it was still one of the only places in the country that actually had a significant number of businesses that specifically catered to people of your size. It wasn’t easy to make items big enough for someone like you, much less build a shop big enough to sell them.
        <br/>The convenience store wasn’t exactly bursting at the seams for inventory or selection. It held far less of a variety of items than the other districts in town did. But it also was one of the only places you could actually get items like snacks and food big enough for someone of your size. It would have taken the entire stock of orange soda from the Variable Village convenience store to fill a single one of the bottled drinks displayed within. Occationally you noticed someone from a smaller size category waiting near the edge of the door for a giant to approach. When one did, they would scurry inside the store before the doors closed. If they wanted to run around the floor beneath their feet and risk getting stepped on that was their business. 
        <br/>The gym was surprisingly one of the more popular businesses around. It was rare for a giant to find anything they could actually get a decent workout with so many of your fellow bigs were eager to work up a sweat with something other than cardio. The equipment may have been a bit simple and crude, much of it looking like glorified scrap metal welded or chained together, but it was sturdy and heavy enough to work. And that was all that mattered. `

        <br/>Mega City was tiny.
        <br/>It was something you never thought you would be able to say with any level of seriousness. Even the other giants down below stared up at you with shocked, wide eyes as you loomed above them all. You could have reached down and scooped up any of the shops from the ground with ease. There was no way that you could possibly fit inside any of them much less that they would have anything of use to you. You were simply too big for even the most size-friendly city in the country. And while that was inconvenient in a lot of ways it still had one benefit that you couldn’t get enough of.
        <br/>It made you feel POWERFUL.`
